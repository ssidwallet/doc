# Issuing a credential

Once a verifiable credential is authored and associated with a learner (including a learner DID), the issuer signs the verifiable credential. In its implementation, the FlexID uses jws-2020 signature suite, which enables use of linked data signatures with well-known and tested JOSE signing implementations.
